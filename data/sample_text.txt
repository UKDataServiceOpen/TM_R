This sample corpus also uses abbreviations sometimes, but not always. California is spelled out once but also written CA. 

To really complicate things, another country name is written as the U.K., the UK, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland becuase sometimes full names are important. 

Further, here is a bunch of unrelated toxt just to fill up the space.
